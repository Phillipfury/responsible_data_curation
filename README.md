### Responsible Data Curation Checklist for Fairness and Robustness Evaluations
To guide curators towards more ethical yet resource-intensive curation, we also provide a responsible data curation checklist for fairness and robustness evaluations. 
The checklist is provided in four formats: [[`.tex`](checklist/rdc_checklist.tex)], 
[[`.txt`](checklist/rdc_checklist.txt)], [[`.docx`](checklist/rdc_checklist.docx)], 
and [[`.md`](checklist/rdc_checklist.md)].
