## Abstract
Human-centric computer vision (HCCV) data curation practices often neglect privacy and bias concerns, leading to dataset retractions and unfair models. HCCV datasets constructed through nonconsensual web scraping lack crucial metadata for comprehensive fairness and robustness evaluations. Current remedies are post hoc, lack persuasive justification for adoption, or fail to provide proper contextualization for appropriate application. Our research focuses on proactive, domain-specific recommendations, covering purpose, privacy and consent, and diversity, for curating HCCV evaluation datasets, addressing privacy and bias concerns. We adopt an ante hoc reflective perspective, drawing from current practices, guidelines, dataset withdrawals, and audits, to inform our considerations and recommendations.


## Responsible Data Curation Checklist for Fairness and Robustness Evaluations
To guide curators towards more ethical yet resource-intensive curation, we also provide a responsible data curation checklist for fairness and robustness evaluations. 
The checklist is provided in four formats: [[`.tex`](checklist/rdc_checklist.tex)], 
[[`.txt`](checklist/rdc_checklist.txt)], [[`.docx`](checklist/rdc_checklist.docx)], 
and [[`.md`](checklist/rdc_checklist.md)].
